		<h2>Terrifyingly Shitty</h2>
		<p>
				This disaster was a fuckin' hoot. The plot starts with this kid who doesn't matter walking around in the woods looking for his birthday party, I guess.  He meets some dude 
			who looks like he just rolled out of the background scene of a bar in some other movie.  The kid runs off after being not at all terrified by chainsmoker mike, not hearing
			the man get ABSOLUTELY decimated by a wolf man who's there for some reason.  Hard cut over to Johnny Big Dick (or Duke I think) trying to convince his girlfriend that 
			he's not a total chode trying to lead them (him and a car behind him driven by his dad-friend) the wrong way.  They go the wrong way.  Hard cut back to Billy at a birthday party
			with no adult supervision.  Count Shitula's head pops out of a box and Billy dies.
		</p>
		<p>
			J.B.D. Duke leads them to a creepy house where they party for all of 5 minutes before some lady finds a Ouija board and decides its a good idea to fuck with it.  Lady gets possessed
			and everyone's all "holy shit wtf".  Hard cut to Count Shitula talking to his dead wife about something.  Meanwhile, possessed Debbie is telling everyone that they will die.  Some
			dude (Willis i think?) promptly gets dragged into a grave.  Contrary to your normal "let's get the fuck outta here" response, the group sticks around.  Wolf man prowls around in the distance.
			They all proceed to die one by one by like, 30 different monsters and Count Shitula revives his wife, who, like the group should've done, got out of there. I have no idea how this movie ended.
		</p>
		<h2> Should you watch it? </h2>
		<p>
			Don't think for a second we weren't laughing our asses off at this movie.  The music sounded like me drunkenly playing around with a Casio, the monsters (which were actually
			surprisingly well designed in some cases) were goofy, the cast made every dumb decision possible, and wolf man existed.  DO NOT watch this movie to follow a plot.
			DO watch this movie to laugh at an incoherent mess of a film.
		</p>
		<h2> FINAL VERDICT </h2>
		<p> Wolf Man / 10 </p>
