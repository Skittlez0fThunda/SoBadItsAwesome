<h1>What is So Bad It's Awesome?</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			So Bad It's Awesome began as a spontaneous idea between some friends watching bad movies through Discord.
			One of these friends, who's fond of reviewers like Red Letter Media, Your Movie Sucks, and Ralph the Movie Maker, suggested
			the group reviews everything they watch together.  Bam, just like that, SBIA is here.  These reviews are NOT meant to be comprehensive
			analyses of the films, but rather an outlet to explain what happened in the film and if it was fun to watch or not.
